# Quiz App

## Description

This is a simple yet engaging Quiz App where users can test their general knowledge. The app allows users to enter their name and age, take a quiz with multiple-choice questions, view their score, and retry the quiz. The app uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the user interface and handle the quiz logic.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for input (name and age).
- Displays multiple-choice questions with answers.
- Tracks user score and displays it after completion.
- Provides a scoreboard with user name, age, and score.
- Option to retry the quiz after completing it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the app responsive and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For handling quiz logic, user interactions, and dynamic content loading.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the quiz app running locally on your machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-app.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd quiz-app
```

### 3. Open the Project in a Browser

Since this is a simple static app, you can open the `index.html` file directly in a browser:

```bash
open index.html
```

Or double-click `index.html` if you're on Windows.

### 4. Modify the Questions

If you want to customize the quiz questions, you can update the `questions.json` file. Add or modify questions in the JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "answers": ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Rome"],
    "correct": 0
  },
  ...
]
```
